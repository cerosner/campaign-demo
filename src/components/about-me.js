    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      As a 40 year resident, you could say I have deep roots in  Hoboken. This city is in my blood. When our friends began having children, they left for the suburbs. My wife and I stayed and raised our two daughters in this incredible "big" little city. <strong>Hoboken is the essence of who we are.</strong> In all those years, I have been actively involved in this town for more than three decades, as an advocate for quality of life issues, families, schools and government. I have supported many candidates for office and voted in every election, knowing in my heart that it was necessary to make your voice heard and to have some positive effect on the evolution of this town. My first public effort as a <strong>co-founder</strong> and <strong>twice elected Board Member</strong> of the <strong>Elysian Charter School</strong>, chartered in 1996 and opened on September 1997, is something I am very proud of. A <strong>lifetime supporter</strong> of <strong>Fund for a Better Waterfront</strong>, the very reason Hoboken’s waterfront exists as it does today, is proof that you need to be actively involved to change things for the better. I have seen many changes through all the years and I believe it’s time to step up. In all my years I have never seen Hoboken so divided. <strong>Our ward and the city need a change.</strong> I will work to unite this city. Together we will win for the ward, for the city, and all the families of Hoboken.
